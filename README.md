### What are .redditvault files?
The `.redditvault` files are the backup files of your Vault. You can identify which Vault a file represents by looking for the address of your Reddit Vault in the filename. For example, “0x….redditvault”.

### Does Reddit store my Vault backup files on their servers?
No, Reddit does not store or at any point has access to your backup files. These files are stored on iCloud/Google Drive, and it’s your responsibility to maintain this storage in good shape.

### If someone steals my backup files, can they access my Reddit Vault?
No, your backup files are encrypted with a key bound to your Reddit account. The only way to decrypt and restore your Reddit Vault is by using your Reddit account to access them on the Reddit app.

### Can I move these files?
You’re free to do additional backups of these files to a storage of your choice, but the files have to remain in this folder to be detected by the Reddit app.
